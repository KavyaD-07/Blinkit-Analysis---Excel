# Blinkit-Analysis---Excel
This project analyzes BlinkIT's grocery data, sourced online, detailing items (type, sales, ratings) and outlets (location, size, year). I created a Pivot Sheet to summarize KPIs like sales and ratings, and a Dashboard Sheet for dynamic visualizations. It demonstrates data-driven strategies to optimize grocery operations and drive business growth.
